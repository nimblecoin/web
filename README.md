Installation
============

Please take a look at the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mpos/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide). This will give you an idea how to setup `MPOS`.

Customization
=============

This project was meant to allow users to easily customize the system and templates. Hence no upstream framework was used to keep it as simple as possible.
If you are just using the system, there will be no need to adjust anything. Things will work out of the box! But if you plan on creating
your own theme, things are pretty easy:

* Create a new theme folder in `public/templates/`
* Create a new site_assets folder in `public/site_assets`
* Create your own complete custom template or copy from an existing one
* Change your theme in the `Admin Panel` and point it to the newly created folder

The good thing with this approach: You can keep the backend code updated! Since your new theme will never conflict with existing themes, a simple git pull will
keep your installation updated. You decide which new feature you'd like to integrate on your own theme. Bugfixes to the code will work out of the box!

Other customizations are also possible but will require merging changes together. Usually users would not need to change the backend code unless they wish to work
on non-existing features in `nimblecoin`. For the vast majority, adjusting themes should be enough to highlight your pool from others.


Contributing
============

You can contribute to this project in different ways:

* Report outstanding issues and bugs by creating an [Issue][1]
* Suggest feature enhancements also via [Issues][1]
* Fork the project, create a branch and file a pull request to improve the code itself
